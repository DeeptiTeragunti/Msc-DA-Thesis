This repository contains the code and documentation for my final year thesis project on **Towards Explainable and Accessible AI Frameworks for Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Diagnosis**. The project focuses on building predictive models to classify Alzheimer's disease (AD) based on patient data and enhancing model transparency through XAI techniques 

The primary goal is to assist in early detection of Alzheimer's while providing interpretable insights into model decisions, which is crucial for clinical adoption.

## Project Overview

Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions worldwide. Early detection can significantly improve patient outcomes, but traditional diagnostic methods are often invasive or expensive. This thesis leverages machine learning to predict AD from non-invasive patient features and uses XAI to make predictions interpretable.


The project demonstrates how XAI can bridge the gap between AI models and healthcare professionals by explaining "why" a model predicts AD.
